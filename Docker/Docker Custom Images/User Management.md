# 🔒 Why Secure User Management in Docker Matters?

> 🧠 By default, Docker containers run processes as **root**, which is:

* A **huge security risk** 🧨
* Can lead to **host exploitation**
* Bad for **CI/CD and prod environments**

### ⚠️ NEVER ship containers that run as root in production!

---

## 🔍 Real-World Analogy

> 🏡 Giving root access is like giving a guest 🔓 *the master key to your house*, including bank vaults, server room, and more.
> 🧑‍💻 Instead, give them **only what they need** – just one room!

# ✅ How to Add a Secure User in Docker

### 📦 Example (Linux-based):

```dockerfile
# Create a group & user with no login shell
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 appgroup \
 && adduser --system --uid 1001 --ingroup appgroup --disabled-password appuser

# Switch to non-root user
USER appuser
```

| 🔑 Command            | Purpose                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `--system`            | Marks as a system-level user/group         |
| `--disabled-password` | Prevents password login                    |
| `USER appuser`        | Runs all next steps as a **non-root user** |

---

## 🔁 Typical Secure Dockerfile Flow

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy and build with root privileges
COPY . .
RUN npm install && npm run build

# 🔒 Create a secure user
RUN addgroup -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -G appgroup

# ✅ Drop privileges
USER appuser

CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

## 🧠 Best Practices for Secure User Management

| ✅ Best Practice                        | 💬 Why It’s Important                   |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 🧑‍💻 **Avoid root** in final image    | Reduces attack surface                  |
| 🔐 Use `USER` instruction              | Ensures all commands run as non-root    |
| 📂 Set correct permissions (`chown`)   | Ensure new user can access copied files |
| 🔍 Audit with `docker scan` or `trivy` | Catch misconfigurations                 |
| 👁️ Keep image minimal                 | Less packages = fewer CVEs              |
| 📜 Use `.dockerignore`                 | Prevent leaking `.env`, `keys`, `.git`  |

---

## 🛡️ Preventing Permission Issues with Files

```dockerfile
COPY --chown=appuser:appgroup . .

# OR fix it manually
RUN chown -R appuser:appgroup /app
```

✅ Ensures the `appuser` has access to source files
⛔ Otherwise you might get `EACCES` or permission denied errors.

## 🔐 Dockerfile Security Summary Table

| Feature            | Good Practice                    | Why?                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `USER`             | Use non-root user                | 🧱 Least privilege              |
| `COPY`             | Use `--chown` flag               | 🧽 File ownership fix           |
| `RUN`              | Avoid `sudo`, limit shell access | 🔒 Prevent privilege escalation |
| `ENTRYPOINT`/`CMD` | Should not run as root           | ✅ Always run app as secure user |

---

## 🧪 Check Current User in Container

You can debug by checking UID:

```bash
docker run -it your-image whoami
docker run -it your-image id
```

---

## 🧰 Bonus Tip: Use Docker Compose Securely

```yaml
services:
  api:
    image: dpvasani56/secure-api
    user: "1001:1001"
```

📌 You can enforce user ID even if Dockerfile doesn’t specify it.

## ✅ Final Checklist for Secure User Management

| ✅ Task                            | Status |
| --------------------------------- | ------ |
| Create system user & group        | ✔️     |
| Assign proper UID\:GID            | ✔️     |
| Switch user with `USER`           | ✔️     |
| Set file ownership (`--chown`)    | ✔️     |
| Remove unnecessary packages       | ✔️     |
| Test permissions inside container | ✔️     |
