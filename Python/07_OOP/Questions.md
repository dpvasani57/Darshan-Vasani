# 🚀 Learn Object-Oriented Programming Through Practical Questions

Explore the core principles of OOP by solving real-world inspired coding tasks. Expand your understanding of classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and more — step by step.

<details>
<summary><strong>1. 📦 Basic Class and Object</strong></summary>

**Problem:**
Create a `Car` class with attributes like `brand` and `model`. Then, instantiate an object of this class and print its attributes.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>2. 🔁 Instance Method and <code>self</code></strong></summary>

**Problem:**
Add an instance method `get_full_name()` to the `Car` class that returns the car's full name by combining its `brand` and `model`.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>3. 🧬 Inheritance</strong></summary>

**Problem:**
Create an `ElectricCar` class that inherits from `Car`. Add an extra attribute called `battery_size`, and create an instance of this subclass.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>4. 🔒 Encapsulation</strong></summary>

**Problem:**
Modify the `Car` class to encapsulate the `brand` attribute (make it private using double underscores). Provide a getter method to access it safely.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>5. 🎭 Polymorphism</strong></summary>

**Problem:**
Define a method `fuel_type()` in both `Car` and `ElectricCar` classes. Make sure they return different outputs to demonstrate polymorphism.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>6. 📊 Class Variables</strong></summary>

**Problem:**
Introduce a class variable in `Car` to count the total number of car instances created. Ensure the counter updates with each new car object.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>7. 🛠️ Static Method</strong></summary>

**Problem:**
Add a static method `general_info()` to the `Car` class that returns a generic description like "Cars have wheels and can be used for transport."

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>8. 🔁 Property Decorators</strong></summary>

**Problem:**
Use a `@property` decorator to make the `model` attribute of `Car` read-only (i.e., it can be accessed but not modified).

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>9. 🔎 isinstance() and Inheritance Check</strong></summary>

**Problem:**
Create an object `my_tesla` of `ElectricCar`. Use the `isinstance()` function to verify whether it is an instance of both `Car` and `ElectricCar`.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>10. 🧩 Multiple Inheritance</strong></summary>

**Problem:**
Create two independent classes `Battery` and `Engine`, each with their own attributes or methods. Make `ElectricCar` inherit from both and demonstrate functionality from each parent.

</details>
